Lately, I have received a PR on [hop.nvim](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim) where the committer wanted to implement
a feature‚Ä¶ that was already there. I realized that even with a great documentation, a wiki, a changelog, official
announcements, people still don‚Äôt read the documentation / feature list and implement things. The problem is that I have
to reject their contributions and they lose time (and I do as well, because I have to review contributors‚Äô code).

So here‚Äôs a quick article I can link in the super fresh [TWiN], website I released a
couple of days ago and that I hope will help with that kind of issues.

# What can you do with Hop

Hop has been around for some time now. I created it back in February 2021, so roughly one year and a half. It has
changed and evolved quite a lot ever since. New hint algorithm, new commands, a _very big_ number of new options and
features. I really recommand people to read the embedded documentation of Hop. Yes, completely. It took me time to write
in a way that it will take you a couple of minutes only to read. So yes, do read it. Get the habit to read the embedded
documentation of the plugins you install, especially after new updates. Or read [TWiN] from now on üòÅ.

## The wiki, the wiki, the wiki!

Yes, Hop has a wiki. It‚Äôs available [here](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim/wiki) and you should read a couple of
pages from it:

- [The ‚Äúdefault‚Äù commands](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim/wiki/Commands).
- [Mastering advanced Hop](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim/wiki/Advanced-Hop). This part contains a couple of
  examples showing you how to use the various Hop Lua functions and options to create a really advanced motion platform.
- [All the configuration options](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim/wiki/Configuration).

Because I know some people will not click on those links and will still open PRs trying to implement features that are
already there, here is a non-exhaustive list of advanced things you can already do, out of the box, with Hop.

## Recreate `f`, `F`, `t` and `T`

It‚Äôs in the wiki and super simple. For that, you just need three options:

- `direction`, which must be set with `require'hop'.HintDirection.BEFORE_CURSOR` or
  `require'hop'.HintDirection.AFTER_CURSOR`.
- `current_line_only`, a boolean.
- `hint_offset`, a super power allowing you to offset the actual jump off the jump target by a given number of
  characters.

So `f` is basically:

```lua```
require'hop'.hint_char1({
  direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.AFTER_CURSOR,
  current_line_only = true
})
```

`F` is then:

```lua
require'hop'.hint_char1({
  direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.BEFORE_CURSOR,
  current_line_only = true
})
```

And in the same idea, `t` is:

```lua
require'hop'.hint_char1({
  direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.AFTER_CURSOR,
  current_line_only = true,
  hint_offset = -1
})
```

And `T`:

```lua
require'hop'.hint_char1({
  direction = require'hop.hint'.HintDirection.BEFORE_CURSOR,
  current_line_only = true,
  hint_offset = -1
})
```

## Jump at the end of things

Hop already can already understand the concept of _beginning_ and _end_ of a jump target. It does not make sense with
all of them, but for most, it can. That is implemented with the `hint_position` option, which has to be one of:

- `require'hop.hint'.HintPosition.BEGIN`
- `require'hop.hint'.HintPosition.MIDDLE`
- `require'hop.hint'.HintPosition.END`

So if you want to jump to the _end_ of words:

```lua
require'hop'.words({
  hint_position = require'hop.hint'.HintPosition.END,
})
```

You can even jump _right after_ the end of a word!

```lua
require'hop'.words({
  hint_position = require'hop.hint'.HintPosition.END,
  hint_offset = 1
})
```

## Callbacks!

You can even use Hop to do something with the jump target that doesn‚Äôt imply jumping, like running a Lua function with
the actual column and line where the hint is. It‚Äôs done with `require'hop'.hint_with_callback`.

Here, no example but an exercise for you: try to use `require'hop'.hint_with_callback` to send a notification (via
`vim.notify`) displaying the jump target chosen by the user by hinting words. Tips: you will need to find the jump
target generator for words.

## Final recommendation

Please, feel free to read `:h hop`. It contains everything I just explained and so much more, like Hop extensions, multi
windows, etc. Have fun hopping around!
